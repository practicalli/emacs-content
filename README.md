# Emacs, Practical.li

![Emacs logo](images/emacs-practicalli-banner.png)

  This is an introduce arguably the most amazing developer tool ever created (so far), Emacs.  Created way back in 1957, its a testament to its power and flexibility that it remains a popular choice for developers as well as a cultural icon in the IT world (along with Vi, Fortran, Lisp, etc).
  
  Emacs, Practial.li is aimed mainly at those starting their journey with Emacs, although due to the versitility of Emacs there should be many topics that are useful for those with more experience (contributions via pull requests are welcome).
  
  The Clojure programming language has recently driven greater interest in Emacs, so we will cover Clojure programming extensively in this book.
  
  Emacs Live is a project by Sam Aaron to provide a comprehensive and extendable configuration for Emacs.  Emacs Live will be use to minimise the work needed to set up Emacs and provide many valuable features as well as a rich developer experience.  Emacs, Practical.li will include an extensive guide to using Emacs with Emacs Live and include any useful tweaks and extensions. 
  
  The overal aim is to present Emacs in a simple to understand and highly practical way, so you can experience how useful it will be for all your work (and play).
